This repository contains the work for the B5W3 End-to-End Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling challenge for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The project aims to analyze historical car insurance claim data from South Africa to optimize marketing strategies and identify "low-risk" client segments.

## Project Objectives:
- Analyze historical insurance claim data.
- Identify low-risk targets for premium reduction.
- Optimize marketing strategy for car insurance in South Africa.

## Repository Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model development.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- `reports/`: Interim and final reports.
- `dvc_config/`: DVC remote storage directory (if using local storage within the repo).

## Key Features:
- **Data Understanding & EDA:** In-depth analysis of insurance data.
- **A/B Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical validation of risk drivers.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Development of models for claim severity and premium optimization.
- **Data Version Control (DVC):** Ensuring reproducibility and auditability of data.
